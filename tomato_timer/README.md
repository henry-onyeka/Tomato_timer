Tomato timer is a simple application that keeps you focused and productive by scheduling work and break sessions consecutively. Traditionally, you have 25-minute focus sessions followed by five-minute breaks and a longer 15-minute break after four consecutive focus sessions.

it tells you exactly when to work and when to take a short break. The basic process is as follows:

Start a 25-minute timer.
Work until the timer rings.
Take a short, five minutes break.
